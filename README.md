## *automotive-types* is a collection of re-usable types for automotive-related scripting

As I grew bored of re-defining the same types over and over again, or to develop fragile codebase that breaks.
This library is an attempt to fix the problem, providing base types and robust retrocompability, reducing development overhead.
